## Tips

- You don't need to register for an account with Oracle, just click the link under the buttons that says "No thanks, just start my download."
- Be sure to click the `execute` before clicking `next` button to install all the various applications on the `Windows` installer
  - If you accidentally forget then go to `add remove programs and features` and remove all applications that start with `MySQL`
- You need to follow the directions below to if you get the application **can't be opened because it wasn't installed from the AppStore on MacOS** message.
  - [Safely open apps on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491#:~:text=If%20you're%20certain%20that,security%20settings%20to%20open%20it.&text=Go%20to%20Security%20%26%20Privacy.,open%20or%20install%20the%20app.)
