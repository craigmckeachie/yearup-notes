# Courseware Retrospective

## What Went Well

- Exercises, Workshops

## What Needs Improvement

- Student Computer Setup
  - Have a Step by Step Guide or Resources
    - Should include
      - Git
      - Visual Studio Code
        - Recommended VS Code Extensions installed: Prettier, Rest Client Etc...
      - Node.js
      - MySQL
      - Postman
    - Directions should be separate for Windows 10, Windows 11, macOS
  - Students should all have administrator priviledges to loaner computers
  - Have one class day to go through install guide with students before they are assigned Pluralsight work on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap on their own
- Too much content in Week 1
  - Possible solutions:
    - Spread Week 1 content over 2 weeks and collapse down content in other weeks
    - Move Agile to Code Wars week or later when content gets significantly lighter
    - Adding Setup day before class should help this issue
    - Split Git content into two books intro and advanced. Put branching and merging and collaboration in book 2
    - Introduce Git using GUI tools built-in to VS Code and later explain corresponding command-line commands
    - Move command-line content to later in course
- Print the materials for the students since many only have one monitor or are not good at managing 2 yet.
- Build in Pomodoro Technique and use it throughout class
- Too many redundant exercises filling a HTML table. Introduce other types of dynamic DOM creation.
- Stop using .innerHTML, it is a bad security practice to teach
- https://stackoverflow.com/a/47945729/48175
- Introduce a library to assist with Dynamic DOM Creation?
- Use VS Code Extension REST Client to teach AJAX initially because it is easier for students to visualize the topic and learn and then later learn Postman
